    "- Struct and union parameters with sizes of two (eight in the case of only SSE fields) pointers or fewer that are aligned on 64-bit boundaries are decomposed into \"eightbytes\" and each one is classified and passed as a separate parameter. Otherwise the are replaced with a pointer when used as an argument.\n",
